Tokyo - Where Tradition Meets Future

Overview:
Tokyo is Japan's bustling capital and the world's most populous metropolitan area. It's a city of contrasts where ancient temples coexist with futuristic skyscrapers, traditional tea ceremonies happen alongside robot cafes, and serene gardens provide escape from neon-lit streets.

Best Time to Visit:
Spring (March-May) is ideal for cherry blossoms, especially late March to early April. Fall (September-November) offers pleasant weather and autumn foliage. Avoid Golden Week (late April-early May) and Obon (mid-August) when locals travel domestically and prices spike.

Top Attractions:
- Senso-ji Temple: Tokyo's oldest temple in Asakusa district. Free entry, surrounded by traditional shops and restaurants. Visit early morning to avoid crowds.
- Tokyo Skytree: World's tallest tower at 634 meters. Observation decks at 350m and 450m offer stunning views. Tickets ¥2,100-3,400.
- Shibuya Crossing: The world's busiest pedestrian crossing. Visit the Starbucks on second floor for best viewing angle.
- Meiji Shrine: Peaceful Shinto shrine surrounded by forest in the heart of the city. Free entry, particularly beautiful during festivals.
- Tsukiji Outer Market: Fresh seafood and street food paradise. Arrive early for best selection and experience.
- Akihabara: Electronics and anime district, paradise for tech enthusiasts and otaku culture.
- Harajuku: Youth fashion capital, especially vibrant on weekends at Takeshita Street.

Tokyo has more Michelin stars than any other city. Must-try foods: sushi, ramen, tempura, yakitori, okonomiyaki, and wagyu beef. Budget: Convenience store meals (¥500-800), casual restaurants (¥1,000-2,000), mid-range (¥3,000-5,000), high-end (¥10,000+).

Transportation:
The train and metro system is incredibly efficient. Get a Suica or Pasmo IC card (¥500 deposit) for seamless travel. Day pass ¥600-900 depending on zones. Japan Rail Pass is economical for multiple city trips but not needed for Tokyo-only visits. Taxis are expensive; trains are faster and cheaper.
